# PWA base project

Base project for a PWA React web app.

This project was created with **Create React App** with the _cra-pwa-typescript_ template.

Includes:

- [React Helmet Async](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async 'React Helmet Async'): Meta tags managing.
- [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router/ 'Reach Router'): New routing support.
- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/ 'Reactstrap'): Bootstrap 4's React implementation.
- Prettier, tslint, eslint: Code styling.
- [Classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames 'Classnames'): Custom classnames managing.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/ 'Styled Components'): css-in-js support.
- [React-ga](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga 'React-ga'): Google Analytics' React implementation.

The app itself only contains 3 pages (Home, Content, About) and a few components. You can use this as a base for creating your own PWA project.
