# PWA Project Template

Project template for a PWA React web app.

This project was created with **Create React App** with the _cra-pwa-typescript_ template.

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/ 'React Router'): Routing support.
- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/ 'Reactstrap'): Bootstrap 5's React implementation.
- Prettier, eslint: Code styling.

The app itself only contains 3 pages (Home, Content, About) and a few components. You can use this as a template for creating your own PWA project.
