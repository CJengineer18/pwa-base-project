# PWA base project
Base project for a PWA React web app.

This project was created with **Create React App** with the *cra-pwa-typescript* template.

Includes:

- [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet "React Helmet"): Meta tags managing.
- [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router/ "Reach Router"): New routing support.
- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/ "Reactstrap"): Bootstrap 4's React implementation.
- Prettier, tslint, eslint: Code styling.
- [Classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames "Classnames"): Custom classnames managing.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/ "Styled Components"): css-in-js support.
- [React-ga](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga "React-ga"): Google Analytics' React implementation.

The app itself only contains 3 pages (Home, Content, About) and a few components. You can use this as a base for creating your own PWA project.
